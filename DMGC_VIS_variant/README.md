## Disclaimer

**Before I go any further, please read this VERY important disclaimer, if you are thinking about making this yourself.**

I made this project first and foremost **for my own purposes**. Nearly all of the features I have included are things I **personally** wanted. I have tried my hardest to make the project modular, if others would like to improve or change things easily, and I have also tried very hard to make the design somewhat less prone to potential errors during assembly (such as spacing out power pins on the FFC connectors). But in the end, every decision I made was for what I wanted the final product to be, with my skill level in mind.

Schematics, gerbers, and the BOM are provided in the various folders. If you choose to build this project yourself, be warned - this is a considerably advanced, and expensive build. You must be comfortable with the fact that you may lose or damage expensive components. **You are 100% liable for any damage done to your property or yourself. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of property incurred while attempting this project, or after completion of the project - you alone accept all risk.** While I am confident in this design, I cannot claim full compatibility with every system configuration. And there may be latent issues that have yet to crop up. I will update this repo if I encounter any, and if you see anything I may have missed, or some dubious design choice, feel free to ask questions or comment as such. Corrections are welcome. However, I **will not** obligate myself to providing tech support. You accept all risks and costs associated to this build if you choose to attempt it.

**DO NOT attempt this project if you are uncomfortable or inexperienced with detailed electronics troubleshooting, or are not proficient in soldering! You will AT MINIMUM need to be proficient in drag soldering and hot air reflowing. If you have not gained proficiency in these soldering skills, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS PROJECT.**

(If you attempt the build, start with attempting to assemble DMGC-PWR-01. This is the toughest board to assemble, and it requires no donor components.)
